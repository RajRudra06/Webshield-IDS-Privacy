Privacy Policy – WebShield IDS

Last updated: December 2025

WebShield IDS is a browser security extension designed to help users identify potentially malicious, phishing, or unsafe websites while browsing the web.

Data Collection and Processing

WebShield IDS does not collect, sell, or share any personally identifiable information.

The extension processes a minimal and limited set of data strictly for security analysis:

Visited website URLs (analyzed at the time of navigation)

Derived URL and domain metadata (such as domain structure and lexical features)

User-configurable extension settings (for enabling or disabling protection and preferences)

The extension does not access or read webpage content, form inputs, credentials, messages, or personal files.

Data Usage

URLs are analyzed in real time to assess potential phishing, malware, or brand impersonation risks.

Analysis is performed using a combination of:

On-device heuristics and onboard machine learning models

Optional backend threat intelligence and machine learning inference when local analysis is inconclusive

Backend communication, when used, exchanges only structured prediction results (such as risk scores and class probabilities). No executable code is downloaded or executed.

User preferences and basic statistics are stored locally using Chrome’s storage APIs.

Browsing history is not stored persistently or tracked beyond the immediate security check.

Data Sharing

No user data is sold, rented, or shared with third parties.

Data is not used for advertising, profiling, or analytics unrelated to the extension’s security purpose.

Data is not used for credit scoring, lending, or financial decisions.

Permissions Usage

WebShield IDS requests only the permissions necessary to fulfill its single purpose:

Host permissions: Required to analyze the URLs of websites the user navigates to for security assessment.

Tabs: Used to detect navigation events and identify the active tab’s URL.

Storage: Used to store user preferences and extension state locally.

Notifications: Used to alert users when a potentially malicious website is detected.

No permissions are requested for accessing webpage content, keystrokes, or user communications.

Data Security

All executable code is packaged within the extension itself.
No remote JavaScript or WebAssembly code is dynamically downloaded or executed.

WebShield IDS complies with the Chrome Web Store Developer Program Policies and follows security best practices to minimize data access and exposure.
